A space game made with Python, Pygame. 
The code is a bit wacky since it's been developed in stages with quite large time gaps but it's relativly devided and should be decently painless to understand as long as you have basic knowladge of Pygame.

Originally one of my first school projects (untill I realised it was way beyond my skills back then...). I now returned to it a bit later to work on it in my free time!
